// Function to generate a random quote
function getRandomQuote() {

}

// Export the function to make it accessible to other modules
module.exports = { getRandomQuote };

You can save this code in a file named randomQuote.js within your project directory.

To use the module in your Node.js application, you can follow the example provided in the previous message:
const { getRandomQuote } = require('./randomQuote');

const randomQuote = getRandomQuote();
console.log(randomQuote);
This will output a random quote each time you run your Node.js application. Feel free to customize the quotes array with your own collection of quotes to suit your preferences!
